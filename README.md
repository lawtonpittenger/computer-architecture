# CGS 3269 Computer Architecture Concepts

## Course Description
CPU organization, current computer architectures, network file servers.
This course will introduce you to the principles and concepts of computer architecture and
organization â€“ the way computing machines actually work. We will go over the history and
layout of the physical computer, the way arithmetic is performed using logical operations,
the way assembly-language instructions become machine-executable code, and aspects of
the performance of computer systems.
